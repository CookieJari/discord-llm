Trying to create a discord bot that uses an LLM

## Reason
IDK Man I'm just tryna make a discord bot that connects to an LLM. I can't afford an OpenAI API key so I'm running this locally

## Setup
1. Download ollama from here and its dependencies (if any): https://ollama.com/ 
2. Download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
3. Open cmd in your cloned repository
4. Run `npm-install` command in cmd
5. Change the .env environment with your discord bot's data (Check this link for creating a bot: https://discord.com/developers)
6. Invite your created bot in a server.
7. Run npm-start
